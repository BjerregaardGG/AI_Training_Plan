            <h4>We take a big pride in making sure that your training program is of the right quality. 
                This means that we have integrated a <strong>man in the loop </strong>in our software, who will take an extra look at your training program,
                before it will be sent to your email of choice. This can take up to <strong>24 hours</strong>, which we hope that you'll understand. 
                Thank you for choosing our service!
